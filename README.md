### ECADMIUM INSTALL ###

Clone this repo into an empty folder

Run './install.sh' to install dependencies


### SIMULATE MODELS ###

cd Blinky_ECadmiu/top_model/

make clean; make all

./BLINKY_TOP

This will run the standard Cadmium simulator. Cadmium logs will be generated in Blinky_ECadmiu/top_model/blinky_test_output.txt
The pin's inputs are stored in Blinky_ECadmiu/top_model/inputs. The value of the output pins will be in Blinky_ECadmiu/top_model/inputs.
SVEC (Simulation Visualization for Embedded Cadmium) is a python GUI that parses these files and steps through the simulation to help debug the models.


### RUN MODELS ON TARGET PLATFORM ###

If you are using a platform other then the Nucleo-STM32F401, you will need to change the COMPILE_TARGET / FLASH_TARGET in the make file.

cd Blinky_ECadmium/top_model/

make clean; make embedded; make flash;
